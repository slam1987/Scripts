# Malware Signature Scanner

This scanner tests files for malicious signatures using a database of known
malware hashes and compares it against local SHA256 file hashes.

If a malicious signature is matched, there will be prompt along with the file
path/name. A copy of the file path/name will be output to a specified file for
further investigation.

I have added a list of malware hashes in the file "signatures".

The database must be in the same format as the supplied "signatures" file. If
another database format is required then modify the `openMalSig` and `malSig`
variables to read from another format.

I may add more functionality in the future such as: quarantine,
time/date logging, and web-scraping online databases for known signatures.

**NOTE:** I decided to do this project because it has been several months since I
wrote anything with Python and I wanted dust off the cobwebs. This was also a
great way to put a hands-on approach to some of the security concepts learned.

**HOW TO USE:** Simple, execute the script and it will ask the user
for required inputs!
